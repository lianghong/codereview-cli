> This warning comes from LangChain using Pydantic V1 compatibility layer, which doesn't support
Python 3.14+.

Options to handle it:

Option 1: Suppress the warning (quick fix):
python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", message="Core Pydantic V1 functionality")


Option 2: Suppress via environment variable:
bash
PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore::UserWarning" python test.py


Option 3: Use Python 3.13 instead (recommended for stability):
bash
uv venv --seed --prompt LangChain -p python3.13


Root cause: LangChain is transitioning from Pydantic V1 to V2. Python 3.14 is very new and the
Pydantic V1 shim isn't compatible with it. Your code still works—it's just a warning.

Best approach: If you don't need Python 3.14 specific features, downgrade to 3.13 for better library
compatibility. Otherwise, suppress the warning until LangChain fully drops Pydantic V1 support.
